welcome to the code of this discord bot
for this bot to work you will need to change the config.json file to have your channel and bot id and also the secret token of your bot

to load a command into your bot you will need to run the command : node deploy-commmands.js
once this is done you can run the command node . and your bot will be running

to make a new command just add a .js file in the commands directory

the template of a new command is :
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
		.setName('NAME OF YOUR COMMAND')
		.setDescription('DESCRIPTION OF YOUR COMMAND'),
	async execute(interaction) {
		return interaction.reply('WHAT YOUR COMMAND NEEDS TO SEND IN CHAT');
	},
};

for more explenation on how those commands work you can get more information on

all my code is based on this guide
