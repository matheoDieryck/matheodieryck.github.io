<h1>Welcome to my discord bot landing page</h1>
<p>This is a personal project of mine that I want to share with the world</p>
<p>I am a first year student in applied computer science</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matheoDieryck/matheodieryck.github.io">Here</a> you can find my repository with the code for my bot</p>
<p>I'll be adding more stuff in the future</p>
<p>If you have any questions you can always message me on discord : matheo#2105</p>
<p>Most of the code has been based from the tutorial <a href="https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin">here</a></p>
